# React, Redux, React Router, Webpack

I wanted to get familiar with `webpack` and that's how this project was born - I have created my own react starter kit.

If anyone wants to get familiar with `webpack` I suggest heading to [SurviveJS](https://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction) which is an amazing resource! Don't worry that `webpack 2` is referenced there, I didn't have any problems applying the knowledge to `webpack 3`.

To get `react-hot-loader` working, I spent some time going through its own [github repository](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) - don't miss out the [docs](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/docs) section where different boilerpates can be found. They are all really helpful to see how other people have set up their projects. [Create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) by facebook is also an excellent resource - don't be afraid to `eject` and look at the config once you are familiar with webpack.

## Usage 

* Clone the repositroy and run `npm install`
* Run `npm start` and change something to see that `hmr` is working.
* Run `npm build` to create a production build.
